This is the game of minesweeper

Minesweeper is a classic computer game that involves clearing a minefield without detonating any mines. The rules of Minesweeper are relatively simple:

Objective: The goal of the game is to uncover all the empty squares on the minefield without triggering any mines. You win the game by clearing all the non-mine squares.
Game Grid: The minefield is represented by a grid of squares. Each square can be in one of three states: uncovered, covered, or flagged.
Mines: Randomly placed mines are hidden throughout the minefield. The number of mines is predetermined based on the difficulty level you choose at the beginning of the game.
Numbers: Each uncovered square, except for those containing a mine, will display a number. The number indicates how many mines are present in the adjacent squaresâ€”diagonally and horizontally.
Uncovering Squares: You can uncover a square by left-clicking on it. If you uncover a square containing a mine, you lose the game. However, if you uncover a square without a mine, it will display a number indicating the number of mines in its vicinity. If there are no mines nearby, it will automatically uncover neighboring squares.
Flagging Mines: If you suspect a square contains a mine, you can flag it by right-clicking on it. This allows you to mark potential mine locations without triggering them. Flagging can be useful for keeping track of potential mine locations.
Adjacent Squares: When a square is uncovered, its neighboring squares will be automatically uncovered if they do not contain any mines. This process continues recursively until all adjacent squares are cleared, creating a chain reaction.
Winning and Losing: You win the game by uncovering all non-mine squares. If you uncover a mine, the game ends, and you lose. Additionally, some versions of the game include a timer, so you can try to beat your previous time records.
